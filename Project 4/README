Divide.asm -  Divides R13 aby R14 and stores the result in R15. Fill.asm - Runs an infinite loop that listens to the keyboard input. 

Fill.asm - When a key is pressed (any key), the program blackens the screen,
		   i.e. writes "black" in every pixel;
		   the screen should remain fully black as long as the key is pressed. 
		   When no key is pressed, the program clears the screen, i.e. writes "white" in every pixel;
		   the screen should remain fully clear as long as no key is pressed.

Mult.asm - Multiplies R0 and R1 and stores the result in R2.

Sort.asm - sort an array of integers R14 contains the address.
