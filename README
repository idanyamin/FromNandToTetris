This is a project I have done at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with Mor Moshe as a part of a course
called From Nand to Tetris, you can read more about the course here: https://www.nand2tetris.org/
In this course we were required to build a computer from Nand gates and Flip-Flops using simulators.
For building the computer we were required to build computer chips like ALU, CPU, RAM etc..
The computer can run Assembly code.
We built a compiler for a high-level programming language called Jack.
It is built in a way that you can write your own Jack code on your computer and then compile your code using
our compiler and get an assembly code, you can then take the Assembly code and run it on our computer.
The compiler firstly translating your code to VM code then it takes that VM code and then translating it to Assembly.
