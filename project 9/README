__________random Implementation____________________

Every time the ball hits the floor there is a message that pops up on the screen saying:
'press any key to continue' when the player presses the button we take the ASCII code of the button.
We made an array of start locations and we chose the location of ASCII mod length of the array.
We do the same for choosing directions (left right) ASCII mod 2, 0 means left, 1 means right.
